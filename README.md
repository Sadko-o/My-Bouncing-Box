# My-Bouncing-Box
Created a box that acts similar to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVp6GMHpYvo)

## How it moves?
I defined the (0, 0) coordinate (x, y) at the very top left of the screen.\
The box must move diagonally and each time it reaches a border it will change direction of the border it touched.\
If the box is moving bottom-right:\
-- when it reaches the bottom border it will go top.\
-- when it reaches the right border it will go left.
